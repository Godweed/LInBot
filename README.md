# LInBot
Increase your popularity on LinkedIn and rank #1 among your network.
## About
In May 2014 LinkedIn introduced a new feature, [How You Rank](https://www.linkedin.com/wvmx/profile/rankings), which will show the most-viewed profiles among one's company and greater network.

This bot will allow you to rank #1 by visiting thousands of profiles, who will visit you in return (around 2.5% of them according to my tests).
## Requirements
**Important:** make sure that you have your [Profile Viewing Setting](https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?trk=nav_account_sub_nav_settings) changed from 'Anonymous' to  'Public' so LinkedIn members can see that you have visited them and can visit your profile in return.

LInBot was developed under [Pyhton 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads).

Before you can run the bot, you will need to install a few Python dependencies.

- BeautifulSoup4, for parsing html: `pip install BeautifulSoup4`
- Selenium, for browser automation: `pip install Selenium`
